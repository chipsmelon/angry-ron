# Angry Ron

I made this Discord bot a bit ago, and I still refused to use slash commands for some reason. It contains a lot of inside jokes and was never meant to be a public bot, but I'm adding it here anyways!

# Hosting the Bot

There's a comment at the start of `index.js` that tells you what should be in `config.json`. Discord.js v13. I'm not gonna help you any more than that because it was always a private bot made for fun anyways.
